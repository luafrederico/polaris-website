">"Home automation gives you access to control devices in your home from a mobile device anywhere. The term may be used for isolated programmable devices, like thermostats and sprinkler systems, but home automation more accurately describes homes in which nearly everything — lights, appliances, electrical outlets, heating and cooling systems — are hooked up to a remotely controllable network.<br><br> From a home security perspective, this also includes your alarm system, and all of the doors, windows, locks, smoke detectors, surveillance cameras and any other sensors that are linked to it.</p>

">Automation</h2>
            <p class="lead"><br>Automation is, unsurprisingly, one of the two main characteristics of home automation. Automation refers to the ability to program and schedule events for the devices on the network. The programming may include time-related commands, such as having your lights turn on or off at specific times each day. It can also include non-scheduled events, such as turning on all the lights in your home when your security system alarm is triggered.

<br>Once you start to understand the possibilities of home automation scheduling, you can come up with any number of useful and creative solutions to make your life better. Is that west-facing window letting in too much light? Plug your motorized blinds into a “smart” outlet and program it to close at noon each day. Do you have someone come by at the same time each day to walk the dog? Program your home automation system to unlock the front door for them, and lock it up again when they’re done.

    text-align: left;
">Remote Control</h2>
            <p class="lead"><br>The other main characteristic of cutting-edge home automation is remote monitoring and access. While a limited amount of 
			one-way remote monitoring has been possible for some time, it’s only since the rise in smartphones and tablets that we’ve had the ability to 
			truly connect to our home networks while we’re away. With the right home automation system, you can use any Internet-connected device to view 
			and control the system itself and any attached devices.

<br><br>Monitoring apps can provide a wealth of information about your home, from the status of the current moment to a detailed history of what has happened 
up to now. You can check your security system’s status, whether the lights are on, whether the doors are locked, what the current temperature of your home is 
and much more. With cameras as part of your home automation system, you can even pull up real-time video feeds and literally see what’s going on in your home 
while you’re away.

<br><br>Even simple notifications can be used to perform many important tasks. You can program your system to send you a text message or email whenever your 
security system registers a potential problem, from severe weather alerts to motion detector warnings to fire alarms. You can also get notified for more 
mundane events, such as programming your “smart” front door lock to let you know when your child returns home from school.

<br><br>The real hands-on control comes in when you start interacting with the home automation system from your remote app. In addition to arming and 
disarming your security system, you can reprogram the scheduling, lock and unlock doors, reset the thermostat and adjust the lights all from your phone, 
from anywhere in the world. As manufacturers are creating more and more “smart” devices and appliances all the time, the possibilities for home automation 
are virtually limitless.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="
    text-align: left;
">Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p class="lead"><br>One clear advantage of home automation is the unmatched potential for energy savings, and therefore cost savings. Your 
			thermostat is already “smart” in the sense that it uses a temperature threshold to govern the home’s heating and cooling system. In most cases, 
			thermostats can also be programmed with different target temperatures in order to keep energy usage at a minimum during the hours when you’re 
			least likely to benefit from the heating and cooling.

<br><br>At the most basic level, home automation extends that scheduled programmability to lighting, so that you can suit your energy usage to your usual 
daily schedule. With more flexible home automation systems, electrical outlets or even individual devices can also be automatically powered down during 
hours of the day when they’re not needed. As with isolated devices like thermostats and sprinkler systems, the scheduling can be further broken down to 
distinguish between weekends and even seasons of the year, in some cases.

<br><br>Set schedules are helpful, but many of us keep different hours from day to day. Energy costs can be even further reduced by programming “macros” 
into the system and controlling it remotely whenever needed. In other words, you could set up a “coming home” event that turns on lights and heating as you’re
 driving home after work, for example, and activate it all with one tap on your smartphone. An opposite “leaving home” event could save you from wasting 
 energy on forgotten lights and appliances once you’ve left for the day.
